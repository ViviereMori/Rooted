# ROOTED 🌱 (Live Shopify Site)

**ROOTED** is a custom Shopify storefront created for a bold and clean apparel brand. The project was focused on keeping the experience minimal, smooth, and responsive — while giving full control over content through editable sections.

It was a great opportunity to learn more about building for real users and translating brand vision into code.
